* Inactive WALs are immediately closed upon being fully sync-ed rather than in a background thread. This is to ensure LinkFile() is not called on files still open for write, which might not be supported by some FileSystem implementations. This should not be a performance issue, but an opt-out is available with with new DB option `background_close_inactive_wals`.
