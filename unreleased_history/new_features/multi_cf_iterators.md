[Experimental] Introduce two new cross-column-family iterators - CoalescingIterator and AttributeGroupIterator. The CoalescingIterator enables users to iterate over multiple column families and access their values and columns. During this iteration, if the same key exists in more than one column family, the keys in the later column family will overshadow the previous ones. The AttributeGroupIterator allows users to gather wide columns per Column Family and create attribute groups while iterating over keys across all CFs.
