Added a new API `GetEntityFromBatchAndDB` to `WriteBatchWithIndex` that can be used for wide-column point lookups with read-your-own-writes consistency. Similarly to `GetFromBatchAndDB`, the API can combine data from the write batch with data from the underlying database if needed. See the API comments for more details.
